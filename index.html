                <p id="text2"> Everywhere you turn, there is a crisis in our oceans - the world's smallest sea turtle racing toward extinction, 
                    harp seals in danger from melting sea ice and dolphins killed in indiscriminate nets.
                    With the support of more than 850,000 activists like you, 
                    we have already protected over 4.5 million square miles of ocean and innumerable sea turtles, sharks, dolphins 
                    and other sea creatures - but there is still so much more to be done.

                        <p id="text2">The devastating eruption of war in Ukraine is driving millions from their homes and now,
                             the consequences of the conflict are radiating outwards,
                              triggering a wave of hunger in the immediate region and around the world.
                            The United Nations World Food Programme is on the ground right now providing critical food assistance to people affected by conflict in Ukraine and other countries.
                            Your gift will make a lifesaving difference today for families affected by conflict around the world:
                            $75 can provide a family with an emergency box containing enough food for an entire month.

                            <p id="text2">The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals®
                                 works to save animals from dogfighting, puppy mills,
                                  hoarding and other cruelty situations.
                                   We provide animals medical care and behavioral rehabilitation,
                                    and help thousands of animals find loving homes every year.
                                     We respond to emergencies when disaster strikes, and fight for stronger laws to protect animals.
                                      When you become an ASPCA Guardian, your regular monthly gift allows us to spend less time fundraising—and more time saving lives.
